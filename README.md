Arcade Volleyball is a simple volleyball game inspired by Pong. I remember playing it on a DOS PC,
but this game was first made for the Commodore 64, and later for Amiga. This version was distributed
on a floppy disk included with the Fall 1989 edition of the Compute!'s Amiga Resource magazine, as an
executable accompanied with its source code.

This repository is a Sega Master System port based on the Amiga source code.
